## About Me

A graduate Computer Science student at Columbia University with a focus on software systems.Highly motivated individual with 2.5+ years of work experience in software design and development.

I have worked as a Software Engineer at Veritas Technologies and currently, I am a Member of Technical Staff, Intern at Nutanix.
My areas of interest are highly scalable and secure software systems design, cloud architecture, data protection, and governance.
Proficient with object-oriented programming in C++, Java, and Python.Other relevant skills include git, SQL databases, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS.

## Professional Experience

#### Nutanix | Member of Technical Staff, Intern | Jun 2021 - Dec 2021

 - Created a centralized structured logging infrastructure to enforce uniformity in logging across different services and produce logs that are machine-readable for quick troubleshooting and statistical analysis.
 - Analyzed snapshot creation and replication workflow for common error points and demonstrated the use of structured logging to resolve these errors. An end-to-end timeline was created by feeding the structured logs to the log-parser.
 - Co-ordinated the effort to increase observability and integrations with teams working on log parsing frameworks and providing analytics dashboard.

#### Veritas | Software Engineer | Jul 2018 - Dec 2020

 - Developed software features for Veritas NetBackup product as a part of the Data Protection and Governance Engineering (DPGE) unit.
 - Fixed 60+ product defects working with containerized services and applications, secure and scalable distributed systems, clustered environments, addressing customer cases.
 - Analyzed 6 product daemons and 10+ product operations identifying security loopholes that pose risk to the customer environment. Fixed more than 20 memory leaks improving performance by 50%.
 - Demonstrated a proof-of-concept consuming OpenSSL framework to enable use of certificates signed by an external certificate authority for secure communication between hosts.
 - Extended the support for use of certificate formats such as pem, der, pkcs1, pkcs7, pkcs12 and allow migration of existing certificate authority within the product domain.
 - Designed a central security infrastructure to be used during product installation/upgrade as a part of product hardening initiative.
 - Presented the feature, “using certificates signed by external authority” to the global Veritas team of 500+ members including customer support, sales and engineering, and was awarded for flawless presentation.

## Research & Projects

#### Energy Profiling of In-memory Caching Systems | Sep 2021 - Present
 - The project aims at reducing the carbon footprint of huge caching clusters in data centers.
 - Analyzed caching cluster traces released by twitter to determine patterns cache hit ratios over time for different cache sizes and caching policies such as LRU, LFU, etc. This was accomplished using CacheLib, CacheBench frameworks.
 - Propose optimizations depending on the production workloads to reduce the overall energy consumption of the cache clusters such as shrinking cache size, powering down caching systems while maintain service level agreements.

#### Columbia Law School - Website - Center for Institutional and Social Change | May 2021 - Sep 2021
 - Developed a website for training and education of students and existing lawyers for leadership skills.
 - The website facilitates creating course content, exercises, and student evaluations. The technologies used for website are React JS, Express JS, MongoDB, DigitalOcean hosting and Node JS.

#### Monument Identification and Signboard Translation using Deep Learning | Aug 2017 - Apr 2018
 - Created an android application which would allow users to perform monument identification and signboard translation.
 - Implemented transfer learning followed by hyperparameter tuning of the Inception deep neural network model to improve its accuracy to 90%. Used Nvidia CUDA for training the model on GPUs.
 - Leveraged image augmentation methodology for data synthesis to increase number of images by 4X in training dataset. Facilitated creation of images with different weather and daylight settings.
 - Trained model was deployed live on google cloud platform to serve an android application for beta testing by users.

#### FooDelight – An online food delivery platform | Aug 2016 - Oct 2016
 - Designed and developed an online food ordering platform using MongoDB as database and php scripting.
 - Optimized image and file storage using GridFS in MongoDB and demonstrated ACID properties for database transactions. The platform was integrated with a mock payment gateway to gain insight into transaction handling.
 - Adopted use of techniques such as rapid prototyping, wireframe designing to acquire feedback on user interface and workflows.
